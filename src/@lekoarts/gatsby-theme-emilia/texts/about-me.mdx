## About Me

I am a French sound designer and composer who made her first steps into sound through classical music studies as a child.

Studying studio recording and mixing techniques first (2013-2015), I decided to explore theatrical sound practices, richer in terms of creation opportunities (2015-2018).

Graduated from the ENSATT (National Superior School of Theater Arts and Techniques, Lyon, France) with a Master of sound design, I decided to extend my audio skills to other forms of media (video games, radio and films) by studying as a Media Art and Design student at the Bauhaus University (Weimar, Germany, 2019-2021) , from which I graduated in December 2021.

So far, my work has allowed me to collaborate with artists from all parts of the globe (France, Germany, Mexico, Vietnam, United States), as well as tailoring one of my greatest assets: my multidisciplinarity (video games, short films, radio plays, theater plays and music productions).
