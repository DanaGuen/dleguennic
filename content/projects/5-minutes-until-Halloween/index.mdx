Project realized during the Ludum Dare 47 Game Jam (2-5/10//2020) following the theme "stuck in a loop".

Halloween is in a few minutes. This year, you didn't bother making a costume.

But the king of Halloween  is not okay with that.

"Five minutes. You will have to repeat the same five minutes, over and over, for all eternity, if you don't bring me a decent costume.

The clock is ticking."

Explore your surroundings and try to find the scariest outfits to satisfy the Halloween King! Otherwise, you might be here a while...
