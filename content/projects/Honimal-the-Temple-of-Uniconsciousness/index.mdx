Such as Honimal, Rise of the Fusian War, Honimal, the Uniconsciousness Temple is a game inspired from the universe of Honimal, created by Nguyen Duc Tri. This game is currently under development in two different versions, one for traditional PC, another one more experimental for fulldome.

This project is a work in progress...more information soon! Meanwhile, here is a glimpse of the OST:

Short walkthrough of my SuperCollider patch in action! The latter is based on the open-source library Mosca and is connected to the Unity session through the Open Sound Control protocole. All the audio handling of the project is coded here, from internal game audio logic to encoding and decoding ambisonics for the full dome. As a complement, the Mosca library allows to generate the position and rotation of the player and the sound sources real-time.

This video aims at testing the precision of the renderred 3d audio in the game space (binaural version, headphones requirred).

​

Note: obviously the sounds here are only test sounds and not those used in the game! ^^

The world of Honimal is a fantasy world created by Nguyen Duc Tri, in which humans and animals can be tied by an invisible, yet powerful bond: Uniconsciousness. Comparable to a network, Uniconsciousness is a flow of shared memories and consciousness between humans and animals, which can only be accessed by a few privileged humans called Purians . As this category of population is a powerful minority oppressing the others (including simple humans - Muddians - or also creatures fused between animal and human -Fusians-), the question of class struggle and humankind definition is at the center of Honimal’s chronology over more than three millennia, also bringing contemporary subjects such as eugenics, intensive breeding or nature enslavement and destruction. Hosting a multitude of characters’ timelines set in different fictional countries, with different cultures, beliefs or technological advances, this world can be approached little by little through a narrative game.

Introduced as the new Guardian of Honimal, the player is invited to explore the temple of Uniconsciousness, where are kept the history and secrets of Honimal’s civilization. As the latter is built around its twelve Guardians, key figures in Honimal’s history, the game environment displays their respective statues circularly around the player. Every guardian has their own zodiac sign, and the player’s goal is to match the statues with their respective constellations to gain Uniconsciousness. Gathering this Uniconsciousness allows them to access the memories of each unlocked guardian, one after another, all contributing to create a global timeline progressively being displayed around the player as they progress in game.
